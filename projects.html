            <h2>Sunflower NLP-C</h2>
            <p>A product of PIXNet hackathon Taiwan. I utilized the Stanford Chinese Segmenter to tokenize PIXNet blog
                data from their API. I grouped words and phrases, with the hope of quantifying political beliefs in the
                Taiwanese blogosphere. My development stack was a Jython NLP to a mongoDB backend, which was to be
                curated and pushed to an AJAX-style database.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section2">
            <h2>Plany</h2>
            <p>I worked for a startup in Taiwan as an Android developer for a social scheduling app. We sought to
                circumvent the problem of setting a date amongst a large of group of people; the app or program would do
                that for you. I worked on the front-end and back-end of the app, but also dabbled in technologies like
                Google Wallet and Maps.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section3">
            <h2>Fantasy Basketball</h2>
            <p>I also play fantasy basketball fanatically. I've also created automated tools (mostly in python +
                mongoDB, but also a little in Go) to help me draft, trade, and pick players off the waiver. I usually
                play at least one public league a year which I only go by my program's decisions. See if you can beat
                me! I'm found <a href="http://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/nba/105300">here</a></p>

        <div class="section" id="section4">
            <h2>Stock Target Prices</h2>
            <p>A small side project in data scraping and devops. I'm assisting the co-founder in extending the core
                services, back-populating historical stock prices to be referenced with analyst's recommendations.
                I'm working with Python + Django, along with boto to utilize AWS services.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section5">
            <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
            <p>Under the supervision of Prof. Ken Jackson, I investigated numerically solving stochastic differential
                equations. I looked into finite difference and finite element methods on the Black-Scholes equation
                for multi-factor bonds. With an eye on processor limits, I also implemented various adaptive meshing
                methods to save processing time and memory.</p>

        <div class="section" id="section6">
            <h2>TimeTracks</h2>
            <p>A product of AngelHacks NYC, 2013. Myself and 4 other friends sought to fill a need amongst construction
                contractors. We built an Android app to leverage the GPS capabilities on a smartphone. Much like Google
                Fit now, it would track a user's location over the course of the work day automatically generate a
                timesheet at the end of the week; it would only require location tagging from the user. I was
                responsible for the Google Maps UI, and for aggregating locations.</p>
